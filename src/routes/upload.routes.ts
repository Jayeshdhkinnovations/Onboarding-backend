// Multer Storage Configuration
//
// Multer's `destination` callback fires as soon as it encounters the file part
// in the multipart stream — at that point `req.body.formId` is only reliably
// populated if the client happened to send the `formId` field BEFORE the file
// field. Since we can't control client field ordering, every upload is first
// staged into a per-request scratch directory here; `uploadFile` (which runs
// after Multer has finished parsing the entire request body) then moves it
// into the real `<userId>/<formId>/brand/...` location once `formId` is known
// for certain.
//
// The staging dir is also recorded on `req._stagingDirs` (not just on the
// eventual `file` object) because Multer doesn't always populate `req.file`/
// `req.files` when it aborts partway through writing a file (e.g. a
// LIMIT_FILE_SIZE error) — the error handler below needs a way to find and
// remove the partially-written staging directory even then.
